## Design Principles

During the development of this portfolio, I applied the following design principles:

- **Contrast**: Used a dark background with light text and accent colors to highlight important elements such as buttons and headings.
- **Balance**: Elements are evenly distributed to create a harmonious layout.
- **Emphasis (Accent)**: Key elements, such as the "Download Resume" and "Contact Me" buttons, are highlighted with vibrant colors.
- **Proportion and Hierarchy**: Larger text size is used for names and headings to guide the user's attention.
- **Repetition and Rhythm**: Repeated colors, fonts, and elements for a consistent design.
- **Pattern and Whitespace**: Careful use of whitespace to create breathing room between sections.
- **Movement and Variation**: The navigation and weather API add dynamic elements.
- **Unified Design**: A consistent color scheme and style ensure cohesion.

## CRAP Principles

- **Contrast**: Sharp contrast between background, text, and buttons ensures readability.
- **Repetition**: Navigation bar, footer, and color schemes are consistently used throughout the portfolio.
- **Alignment**: All content is organized with strict left, center, or right alignment for a professional appearance.
- **Proximity**: Related information is grouped together, improving the user experience.

## Color Scheme

I chose a **monochromatic color scheme** with varying shades of dark blue and purple for the background and text, complemented by accent colors in orange and green for interactive elements. This gives the portfolio a modern and sophisticated feel.

## Typography and Styling

- **Primary Font**: "GeistMono", a modern sans-serif font, is used for clarity and readability.
  - Font source: `url(fonts/GeistMono-VariableFont_wght.ttf)`
- **Font Styling**:
  - Larger fonts for headings and key text, smaller fonts for secondary text to enhance hierarchy.
  - **Font Weight**: Bolder weight for headings, lighter for body text.
  - Italics and bold are used sparingly for emphasis.

## Icons and Graphical Elements

- **Icons**: Social media icons (GitHub and LinkedIn) in the footer are simple and clear, providing quick access to my profiles.
- **Visual Elements**: Minimalistic patterns and icons ensure the design remains clean and user-friendly.
